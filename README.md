## Challenge 

Managing and analyzing a large volume of data related to orders, inventory, delivery times, 
customer feedback, and operational metrics can be overwhelming. Without a centralized 
dashboard, decision-making becomes inefficient, impacting overall performance and 
customer satisfaction.

# Goals
- Develop a comprehensive dashboard to consolidate and visualize key performance 
indicators (KPIs) such as: 
> Number of daily/weekly/monthly orders. 

> Delivery time trends and bottlenecks. 

> Inventory status and restocking requirements. 

> Customer satisfaction ratings and feedback analysis. 

> Revenue and profit margins. 

-  Enable real-time updates and dynamic filtering for interactive data exploration. 

-  Provide actionable insights to improve operational efficiency and customer 
experience. 

## Target Audience 

- Business stakeholders looking for high-level summaries of performance. 

- Operations managers requiring granular data for process optimization. 

- Data analysts and engineers exploring the backend data for advanced insights. 
# Key Features

1) Intuitive charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts) for quick 
understanding. 

2) Drill-down capabilities for detailed data exploration. 
3) Filters to segment data by time periods, regions, or product categories. 
4) Export options to share reports with team members. 
## Expected Outcomes
- A user-friendly dashboard that empowers stakeholders to make data-driven 
decisions. 
- Increased operational efficiency through enhanced data visibility. 
- A template or framework that can be adapted to similar quick-commerce 
businesses.
